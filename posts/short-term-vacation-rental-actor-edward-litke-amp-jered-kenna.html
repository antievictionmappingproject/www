  <strong><span>Conversion of an SRO to a Live/Work Tech Hub</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <br />The 50-unit Sierra Hotel above T-Mobile was vacant for years, prompting
  Homes Not Jails squatters to invade in a 2011 protest. Two years ago, it
  became home to
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.20mission.com/">20Mission</a>, a tech and
  artist live-work space. Still an SRO on the city’s books, the very symbol of
  downtrodden San Francisco has become a different kind of symbol:
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.20mission.com/co-working.html"
    >a techie dorm</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  An article was written about it in

  describes how Bitcoin millionaire Jered Kenna charges $1800/month for a small
  room with shared bathroom.

<p>
  An owner of many large properties in San Francisco, Litke is known for his
  dilapidated apartments and has been convicted of wrongfully evicting tenants.
  Living in an expansive mansion in Hillsborough with a fortune estimated in
  2011 at $40 million, he operates
  <a target="_blank" href="http://litkeproperties.com/">Litke Properties.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Longtime owner of the Sierra Hotel, an SRO at 20th and Mission, he allowed it
  to fall into complete disrepair, and after it closed, kept the large building
  empty for many years. The empty blighted building was occupied twice - in 2010
  and 2011 - by community activists:

<p>
  Now in it’s make-over as a tech dorm and Hacker Space, while remaining on the
  books an SRO, Litke flaunts City regulations. After being cited by Planning
  last year for leasing the retail space as formula retail, he applied for and
  got the okay to keep TMobile on the corner.

    the eviction of the Chacon family, 40 year tenants at 264 Dolores resulted
    in a $1.2 million award. </a
  >After the eviction, the home remained vacant.
