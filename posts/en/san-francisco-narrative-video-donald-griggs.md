Made in collaboration with SOTA

Donald Griggs is facing displacement and currently part of a Rent Strike, along with his fellow tenants, at Midtown Apartments in the Fillmore. An apartment complex that has history going back to the Redevelopment of the 1970's. Donald and the other tenants at Midtown are still fighting to stay in their homes. Please support the campaign. This video was produced in collaboration with the San Francisco Ruth Assawa School of the Arts. The interview was shot by Marianne Maeckelbergh and Brandon Joudan and edited by students Shiloh Arkinson and Avidan Novogrodsky-Godt.
