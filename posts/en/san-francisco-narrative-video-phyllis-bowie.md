Made in collaboration with SOTA

Phyllis Bowie is facing displacement and currently part of a Rent Strike, along with her fellow tenants at Midtown Apartments in the Fillmore. An apartment complex that has history going back to the Redevelopment of the 1970's. Phyllis and the other tenants at Midtown are still fighting to stay in their homes. Please support the campaign. This video was produced in collaboration with the San Francisco Ruth Assawa School of the Arts. The interview was shot by Marianne Maeckelbergh and Brandon Jourdan and edited by students Shilo Arkinson and Avidan Novogrodsky-Godt.
