Julie Chan & Jason Chan
-----------------------

"[J](http://realestatesf.com/jason-chan)[ason Chan](http://realestatesf.com/jason-chan) of [Barbagelata Real Estate](http://realestatesf.com/) is completely bypassing the law and selling our apartment right out from under us," Lisa Gonzalez, a single mother who is also caring for her elder, disabled mother, her grandmother, and her daughter. Lisa's family has lived in the same apartment at 255 14th Street for over 5 generations. The building was built in 1907.

The three units of 251-255 14th Street were sold to Jason Chu Chan and two others for $1,380,000 in 2006. The building was condo converted in 2012. Jason has retained 251 14th Street, and is now selling it for $549,000 with his wife, [Julie Chan](http://realestatesf.com/julie-chan), through the real estate company that they work for, [Barbagelata](http://realestatesf.com/).

All along, the Chan's plan was to evict sell the unit with the suggestion that the buyer Ellis Act evict them. As Lisa overheard them say during a recent open house, "Why would we bother buying this place if we can't get rid of them?"

The Gonzales's were supposed to be offered a lifetime lease when the building was condo-converted in 2012. To bypass this, Jason Chan had one of the neighbors, Ricky Wong, deliver the notice to Lisa's disabled mother Marilyn, who can't see well, at 9pm at night after her chemotherapy. Because Marilyn was in post-chemotherapy shock, because it was late at night, and because she is visually impaired, she did not understand what Ricky handed her.

All that the family wants is the lifetime lease and the right to stay in their home. Instead, Jason Chan, who has boldly ignored the legal requirements to offer right of refusal to tenants to purchase their own apartments, is having Julie hold weekly "open houses" right on top of Lisa, her mother Marilyn, her grandmother Benilda, and her 19-year-old daughter Tameryn, increasingly intimidating them all.

Lisa has explained that her family has had to deal with a superficially remedied mold problem in their home, and that there have never been any repairs made my Chan or the Barbagelata even though they were notified.

"[We have nowhere to go, my mother and grandmother have nowhere to go, this is our family home, this has been our family home for generations," Lisa concluded in an interview with POOR Magazine, fighting back a river of tears.](http://www.poormagazine.org/node/5170) Lisa was conceived in 251 14th Street in 1969.

Lisa contacted the Mayors office who blindly referred her family to an over-worked landlord tenant lawyer who said he couldn't help them until, "they received an eviction notice"   leaving the family with no options but to withstand these continual, disrespectful and blatantly illegal "open houses" of their home.

**Julie Chan has Ellis Act evicted two units in the past at 2807-2809 Bryant Street on 7/31/06. She then sold the building in 2009.**

Jason's website brags that he is the "Sunset & Parkside district #1 agent from 2007-2013 based on total # of sales AND total sales volume. Specializing in single family homes, multi-units, and commercial buildings. Expert in trust sales, probate sales, short sales, and 1031 exchanges. Jason has been selling real estate since 2002. Prior to becoming a realtor, he worked as a financial analyst at First Republic Bank where he analyzed real estate loans & bank deposits and created financial models to forecast the Bank's financial position.  
  
Jason is a member of the SF Association of Realtors, National Association of Realtors & the Chinese Association of Realtors. His awards include Prudential Chairman Circle 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, & 2007. As a Prudential Legend award winner representing sales professionals/teams who have earned the Chairman's Circle award for the 5th straight year, his exceptional performance has placed him the #1 producer in the Prudential California Realty Sunset/Lakeshore office for years 2005, 2006, & 2007, and putting him in the top 1% of the Prudential Real Estate network.  
  
After six successful years with Prudential, Jason joined Barbagelata Real Estate located at 45 West Portal Avenue, San Francisco in 2008 where his client oriented service placed him as the #1 producer in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, & 2013.  
  
Jason is fluent in English & Chinese (Cantonese & ToiSunese). He enjoys working with people, and he is committed to integrity and excellence in assisting people with ALL their real estate needs!"
