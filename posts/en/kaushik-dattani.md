**KAUSHIK M. DATTANI**
----------------------

**Kaushik "Ken" Mulji Dattani notoriously** **Ellis Act evicted Patricia Kerman and Tom Rapp from their home at 3305 20th Street.** Patricia is a disabled senior and the two have been roommates there for fifteen years. They have lived the for 27 and 15 years, respectively. Since Kerman is a senior and disabled, they were given a year’s notice to vacate as per the Ellis Act’s senior and disability provisions. Patricia describes how now that Dattani can make more money on the property since the neighborhood has changed, she is being forced out.  “And I have no place to go,” she explained. “It terrifies me.” Tom expounds: “I don’t think it’s right to displace long term tenants so new people can move in. I don’t think it’s right to displace the very culture that makes SF attractive to move to. **We are fighting for the sole of the city**.” At a recent protest outside of his office. Protesters, including Tom who had an appointment with Dattani and Co., entered the building to deliver a letter asking Dattani to drop the eviction, but were met by men with baseball bats.

Ken Dattani works with CPA **Tej K. Dattani**.

**This is not Dattani's first Ellis Act.** [In 2007, twelve tenants from 3465 19th Street (at Lexington) were Ellis Acted by Dattani.](http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=6831) They had lived there from between five to 32 years, and had deep ties to the Mission community. This included Hilda Lisa Vasquez, an 82-year-old who woke up every day at 6:00 a.m. to clean the neighboring sidewalk. 

**Addresses that Dattani has Ellis Acted 24 units:**

*   **3305-3321 20th Street (9 units)** - Petition L131379, 8/16/2013, by Kaushik Mulji Dattani, as Trustee Of The M. Dattanl Credit.
    
*   **3465 - 3469 19th Street ( 3 units) -**Petition L0719642007, 12/5/2007, by [363 Valencia, LLC](#).
    
*   **3224 - 3248 22nd Street ( 13 units)** - Petition L071559, 10/10/2007, by Kaushik Dattani, as Trustee of the M. Dattani Credit Trust.
    

**In July 2013 he acquired 204 to 214 Capp Street.** Most of the building is comprised of families with children, and Latinos reside in at least 5 of the units. He's evicted at least 2 units since his ownership, and re-rented out one unit to new tenants. Immediately after acquiring the building, he sent a letter to all tenants stating that he would be changing the locks of the entrance of the building and that he needed to get all information from tenants in order for them to get a key to the building. The information he was requiring from tenants included: IDs, SS #s, and rent receipts. He would also set times to meet with tenants in his office and try to bully them into signing agreements which they did not understand, pressure them into self-evicting, or offer them buyout agreements. Currently, there are many repairs that need to be completed in the building (including bedbugs) but he has refused to fumigate for bedbugs but has completed some repairs in some units. [More on the harassment here.](https://missionlocal.org/2018/09/striking-new-mural-of-gandhi-cesar-chavez-mlk-mother-theresa-is-funded-by-one-of-missions-most-detested-landlords/)
