ASHOK K. GUJRAL and TODD W. RHODES
----------------------------------

[Ashok K. Gujral](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/ashok-k-gujral/47539786.aspx) attempted to evict a 10-unit building at 23rd and Florida Street in the Mission through his newly formed [2882-2898 1/2 23rd St. LLC](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/2882-2898-1-2-23rd-st-llc/134871446.aspx), which lists Todd W. Rhodes as its registered agent, and [Caareal Investments](http://www.corporationwiki.com/p/2absgg/caareal-estate-investments) as the member corporation. Rhodes also lists [Cw Rhodes Trustee of The Cw Rhodes Trust](http://www.corporationwiki.com/Michigan/Milford/cw-rhodes-trustee-of-the-cw-rhodes-trust-agreement-dated-oct/138269769.aspx), headquartered in Milford, MI, as a key member of the LLC. The business address is listed at 2010 Ocean Ave Ste E, San Francisco, CA 94127, the same address that Gujral houses all of his LLCs.

The Ellis Act was petitioned on September 6, 2013 under L131462. Many of the residents of the building are immigrants. Some are 1st and 2nd generation and grew up in the building; some have lived there for 46 years.

This was Gujral’s first involvement with an Ellis Act, though he is responsible for the displacement of many other people through foreclosures. Infamously, in December 2010 his [True Compass, LLC](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/true-compass-llc/47618659.aspx) attempted to remove [Josephine Tolbert](http://www.alternet.org/story/153294/activists_fight_back_against_the_1_after_investors_lock_a_75_year-old_great-grandmother_out_of_her_home_%5Bwith_photo_slideshow%5D), a 75-year-old great-grandmother and cancer survivor who makes her living offering child-care for low-income families. She had owned the house since 1973. Extensive protests, including a [crucial protest](http://www.calorganize.org/node/863) in front of the Roti Bistro on West Portal Avenue, which is co-owned by Ash K. Gujral, prevented her dispossession.  

Some of Ash's LLCs have played notorious roles in displacing people through foreclosures.

                                   [**50 Bronte, LLC**](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/50-bronte-llc/103358629.aspx)
