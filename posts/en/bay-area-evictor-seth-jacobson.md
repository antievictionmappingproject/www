Michael Marr / Community Fund LLC
=================================

Michael Marr and his Community Fund LLCs acquired over 1500 homes in the San Francisco Bay Area.  He has flipped many of them, earning enormous profits, often holding the loan on the property,  while remaining a landlord to hundreds of others.  His [trial for bid rigging](https://www.justice.gov/atr/upcoming-public-hearings-pending-cases#marr) at foreclosure auctions ended in a conviction.

One lifelong resident of East Oakland has been [resisting eviction](http://www.oaklandpost.org/2017/03/31/76-year-old-woman-and-supporters-fight-to-save-home-from-citys-largest-landlord/) from her home of 50 years. While the [San Francisco Chronicle](http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/East-Oakland-eviction-saga-is-complex-11056517.php) covered the story, they did not connect the dots, failing to mention the name of the indicted evictor. 

Because most of the properties that Marr acquired are single family homes, they do not fall under rent control per [Costa Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa-Hawkins_Rental_Housing_Act).   Widespread displacement of long time residents through rent increases has been the modus operandi for Marr and other foreclosure speculators in the east bay.  Unknown numbers of families have left their homes, while [some resisted](http://abphy.com/media/BLrDNjrjtGl).   [Senate Bill AB1506](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1506)  would address the problem, but is stalled in the State Senate under the power of the landlord lobby.
