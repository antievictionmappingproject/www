Made in collaboration with SOTA

Praveen Sinha, a software engineer who lives in the Mission district, fought his eviction and won. His building is now owned by the San Francisco Land Trust. This video was produced in collaboration with the San Francisco Ruth Assawa School of the Arts. The interview was shot by Rebecca Gourevitch of the AEMP for her amazing short 'Holding Out', with additional photography and editing by students Ethan Bresnick and Madelynn Hewett.
