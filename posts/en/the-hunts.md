The Hunt Family:  Brian and Erica Hunt; Sam and Diana Hunt
----------------------------------------------------------

_Brothers Brian and Sam Hunt and their respective wives, Erica and Diana have made a fortune flipping San Francisco properties, converting multi-unit buildings into single unit luxury homes, and lately evicting tenants. After buying a massive home in Ross, they turned to the notorious eviction attorney Andrew Zacks, to help them heighten their profiteering.  With evictions at 306-308b Bartlett and 1964 Larkin Street, they add human suffering to their portfolio toolbox._

Hoodline reported on the June 2015 protest of the eviction of tenants at 1964 Larkin Street.

["Theresa Flandrich of the North Beach Tenants Committee was at the protest in support of the residents of 1964 Larkin. "These are speculators mostly from out of state, many from out of country, and they are destroying our neighborhoods," she said. Flandrich had flyers listing a network of agencies that help tenants fight evictions and giving tips such as, "Keep a written record of any incidents of harassment."](http://hoodline.com/2015/06/jane-kim-aaron-peskin-lead-eviction-protest-landlord-gives-his-side)

[One of the tenants, Robert Dodd, who has AIDS and is a cancer survivor, worries that the stress of an eviction and move will take a toll on his health. "If I don't have this apartment, I don't know what I'm going to do," he said. He said the building's owners, Brian and Erica Hunt, offered him $50,000 to move out. The Hunts own seven other properties in the city."](http://hoodline.com/2015/06/jane-kim-aaron-peskin-lead-eviction-protest-landlord-gives-his-side)
