  MARTIN J. COYNE
=================

**Martin Joseph Coyne is currently evicting the 80-year-old poet Diego Deleo from his home in North Beach, at 566-568 (4 units) Chestnut Street.** The Assessors site lists the trust of MJC. The petition was filed on July 1, 2013 by: Martin J. Coyne, Margaret J . Coyne, As Trustee Of The Cfc 2012, and Maria Elena Esciarnado.

Margaret J. Coyne (Paoli) is Martin's sister, and is married to [Thomas A. Paoli](http://www.paoligeerhart.com/attorneys/tom-paoli/). She also goes by Margaret Paoli. She is quite wealthy with recent acquisition of Glen Ellen property. She is a lawyer, and ED of [Advokids](http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/104331). Interestingly, "[Advokids was established in response to the alarming number of infants and small children entering foster care in the San Francisco Bay Area who were experiencing multiple placements and lingering in temporary care, often for several years](http://advokids.org/about-us/)." Tom "[volunteers in the Bar Association of San Francisco’s Free Legal Advice Clinic program, and for the San Francisco Homeless Connect Project."](http://www.paoligeerhart.com/attorneys/tom-paoli/)

Both Martin and Maria are listed as unmarried. Martin and Margaret's mother, Joan, [recently passed away.](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?pid=164388608)

Martin is using notorious Ellis Act lawyer Zacks & Freedman for representation in evicting Diego.

Marty Coyne and Mike Roddy also own the bar [La Rocca’s Corner](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Leo-La-Rocca-his-North-Beach-saloon-was-2541697.php) at 957 Columbus Ave. 

Martin is the only person that Diego has spoken to regarding anything having to do with his home. Diego initially received the standard relocation fee check from "Coyne Developer Corporation", but later received checks from "Martin J Coyne " with a PO box in SF.

One of Coyne's brothers mentioned that Martin "rents" on Grant Avenue.

Info about Coyne's past legal case here:  [CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. Martin J. COYNE et al., Defendants and Appellants.](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1019103.html)

Martin and his 2 daughters supposedly moved into the top unit of Diego's building after evicting the tenants at the end of April. The "bookkeeper of Coyne" bought the bottom unit as a TIC. There is a couple and school aged daughter in the middle unit. Diego lives in the far back cottage.

**Diego Deleo**
---------------

**As the image and words on Diego Deleo's passport show, Diego came to this country at age 17 from Bari, Italy. Initially, he worked as a laborer with bricklayers and as he said to a friend, "I helped build this city of San Francisco, I don't understand that with the Ellis Act I will now be forced out." He has lived in North Beach for over 40 years, and for the past 30 years in his home on Chestnut Street. His wife Josie died a few years ago and his memories of his life with her are in the walls of his home and heart.** They renewed their wedding vows at St. Peter and Paul church, where they had been longtime parishioners, and their photograph of that precious event faces Diego's kitchen table.

Diego's last job was with the San Francisco Police Department as a "Senior Escort Crime Prevention Specialist." He worked with the department for 25 years, until the program lost funding. Now that he is 80 years old, widowed and alone, his longtime home and new passion for poetry are the two things that sustain him. You will find him on his daily walks along the Embarcadero and then at the Piazza, Washington Square Park, giving out his poems to strangers and regulars alike. Diego's life is here in North Beach and he apologizes that he must fight to stay in his home. It is not in his nature, nor in his culture "to fight" but he says he must. Please help Diego remain in his home, in his community.

Hear his own words here from KALW: [http://kalw.org/post/ellis-act-evictions-diego-deleo](http://kalw.org/post/ellis-act-evictions-diego-deleo)

“My name is Diego Deleo. I live in North Beach, and I have been Ellis Acted about two months ago so I have another 10 months to stay, and then I move out. I have to.

“I live in North Beach 40 years, 40 years. I moved in there with the wife. Now, she passed away. I’m by myself. The doctor said find something to do, because I was too lonely. It’s terrible to be alone. I started to write.

“And through the little things I write, I call them poetry, I make a lot of connections in North Beach. I have a lot of friends that meet at Washington Square. I make a lot of connections in North Beach. We get together, we talk about things that I never thought I’d be able to do. Because I’m into it now, I love it. North Beach is my life.

“So, I receive this Ellis Act notice. I didn’t know what Ellis Act was. And then I read in the paper, there’s an epidemic of Ellis Act all over the city.

“And so I went to see, how they call them, the assistance for the elderly about eviction. So they suggest me, that I will have to go by the Ellis Act, I cannot fight it.

“For an old person like me, pretty soon I will be 80 years old. I go five, 10 miles from here. It’s difficult to get adjusted to a new environment, friends, stores. It will shorten my existence considerably.

“Furthermore, you live 30, 40 years in one place, all the love and the spirit of the experience, and the wife, and the family member there.

A lot of memories there. The move is not a picnic, not a good thing. But I accept it, what can you do? That’s capitalism, that’s reality.

“I don’t know. Well, because I’m alone now, a studio will do. A small place, a studio. I should be able, well, I don’t make much money. Social security pension, because I worked for city for 25 years. I used to be senior escort program.

“We will see. At my age it’s a death sentence in a way. It is, hurts.”
