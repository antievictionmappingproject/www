Anne Kihagi / Ana Swain  
**Aliases: Anne Kihagi, A Kihagi, Ann Kihagi, Ana Swain, Anna Swain, Ann K Swain**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### _Using a number of aliases and family members to do OMI (Owner Move In) evictions on multiple properties, she is also known to threaten, harass, turn of water, cut lines, create "House Rules", install security cameras to put tenants under surveillance, and violate building codes.  OMI evictions at these properties: 3947 18th Street #5, 3947 18th Street #1, 195 Eureka #4,  71 Hill.   She is known in the Los Angeles area as well, and has a series of suspended LLCs._

### Kihagi worked for Credit Suisse and then Bear Stearns as a mortgage analyst prior to their failure in 2008 as part of the global financial crisis and recession. She subsequently began buying rental properties around Los Angeles, focusing on rent controlled areas. In 2013 she expanded into the San Francisco market, purchasing at least 10 properties in 18 months.

### Family members (or other aliases) involved in Owner Move In evictions:

*   ### Julia Mwangi, also known as Julia Munene, a graduate student at UCSF’s School of Pharmacy.
    
*   ### Christine Mwangi, also known as Christine Munene and Christine Johnson, nickname Kabu.   She is being investigated by the City of West Hollywood, CA. There have been multiple lawsuits filed.
    
*   Mary Kihagi, their mother, actively involved and noted as member of family business

### Kihagi uses methods such as using threatening texts, voice mail messages and multiple three-day notices to scare long-term tenants. She repeatedly accuses tenants of not paying rent or violating her house rules, which are intentionally ambiguous in nature. She delays repairs and has been known to turn off water and utilities. She has cut tv cables in front of tenants and turned off water in apartments for more than 24 hours at a time. She has taken away laundry services without reason. She has had private security block access to city building inspectors. She has boarded up a garage with a tenant’s car inside. She has towed a tenant’s car out of it’s garage. She has placed surveillance cameras in building interiors, pointed at tenant’s doors.  Kihagi may turn against tenants  at anytime with vitriol.

### She uses an unscrupulous lawyer in SF who has attempted to re-write all tenants leases by issuing new ‘House Rules’ and states that by not complying to these House Rules, tenants are operating in ‘peril’ of eviction.  She is [currently evicting a 70 year old tenant](http://sfist.com/2015/03/11/landlord_accusing_70-year-old_grand.php) who has lived in her unit for four decades.

### Anne Kihagi Swain and her sisters Julia and Christine Mwangi have issued four OMI’s despite having over 6 vacant units in many of the same buildings. They are now evicting Dale Duncan and Marta Munoz and their 6 year old. “We called the Building Department, and the next day she boarded up the laundry room, and then a week later she served us with and OMI eviction,” said Dale Duncan “there is an empty unit in the building, why does she need the unit I have been in over 20 years. It is nothing but greed.” Swain and her sisters had bought 11 buildings with over 50 units in the last year, pushing out tenants out in over 15 of those units using various means.

### She is notorious for violation of many building codes throughout the City and uses unlicensed workers, putting the safety of tenants at risk.

Evictions
---------

### Kihagi and her sisters have served 4 OMI evictions in 18 months at 3 different properties:

### 3947 18th Street #5 - OMI for herself, evicting the current tenant, despite having other vacant units.

### 3947 18th Street #1 - Relative OMI to move in her sister, Julia Munene/Mwangi, who reported that she lived at 1342 11th Avenue. This OMI was retracted as she later evicted tenant on false nuisance charges

### 195 Eureka #4: Kihagi/Renka Prop LLC transferred 25% ownership of her property to Julia Mwangi/Munene, who lives at 1342 11th Avenue. Mwangi in turn OMI’ed the the long-term tenants.

### 71  Hill Street: Kihagi/ Zoriall LLC transferred a 27% interest to Christine Mwangi/Johnson/Munene. Deed transfer occurred days after Kihagi threatened to do so  in retaliation for tenants allowing city inspectors access to building. There is currently another vacant unit in building.  This OMI is displacing a family of 3.   Christine lives at 3947 18th St. #5.
