Anthony & Patricia Theophilos
-----------------------------

Anthony Theophilos is a real estate attorney who sits on the Piedmont Planning Commission, acts as a court-appointed receiver for distressed properties, and advises and publishes on real estate matters for the Continuing Education of the Bar (CEB).  Patricia Theophilos is a senior banking executive and consultant, having worked at Bank of the Orient, US Bank, Pacific National Bank and Citicorp Real Estate. Together and through their LLCs, they have served 217 eviction notices on their three Oakland properties. 

According to the [Starr Finley LP website](http://www.starrfinley.com/attorneys_detail.asp?propid=105), Anthony Theophilos’ law practice emphasizes the acquisition and disposition of large commercial retail, multi-family and mixed-use projects. His clients include developers, major real estate investment trusts, money-center and foreign banks, life insurance companies, pension funds, savings and loan associations, offshore-based corporate investors and residential mortgage banking firms.  Patricia has been working with a non bank lender to “dispose” their  $300 million REO portfolio at “significant gain” for the client.

The couple was involved with the entitlement of Symphony Towers in San Francisco, which was supposed to be a 141 unit affordable rental housing development before a [“bait and switch](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Planning-official-OKs-switch-to-2705135.php)” occurred after they transferred the property to a condo developer with language in the approval that allowed for the switch.
