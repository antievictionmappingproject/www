###   

  

### The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project and the Regional Tenants Organizing Network collaborated to produce **_Tenants Rise Up!_: _Fighting for Housing Justice in the Bay Area_,** a short documentary to set the record straight on what we’re fighting against, what we’re fighting for, and how we’re on our way to win housing for all.  
  
  

  

### **More About The Film:**

### **_Tenants Rise Up!_** weaves together stories and analyses of tenants, housing justice advocates, and movement leaders across three cities in the Bay Area: Oakland, Santa Rosa, and San Jose. Together, these stories uplift how community organizing, mutual aid, and direct action are crucial ingredients for bringing about the Just Transition we need to make _homes for all_ a reality both in the Bay Area and across the nation.
