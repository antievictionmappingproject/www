Matt/Madhu & Anjali Sridhar
===========================

The Sridhars own millions of dollars in property all over the bay area, including [one building in Alameda with 33 families,](http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/27/alameda-tenants-at-apartment-complex-face-eviction-again/) whom the Sridhars (and their financial partner, Richard Strock) saw fit to evict en mass.  The community organized and is resisting displacement, with the support of the [Alameda Renters Coalition](http://thealamedarenterscoalition.org/) and the Alameda City Council.  [Matt gained notoriety by writing a letter to council,](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2015/12/08/alameda-landlord-who-evicted-33-families-slams-councilmembers) stating "I will tell you with certainty that if you pass rent control, I will SELL my property in Alameda and move on to improve another town.”  That is exactly what any community can hope for!
