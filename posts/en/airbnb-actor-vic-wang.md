**VIC WANG**: The HackerHome Network
------------------------------------

“Whether you're new to the Valley, bored with your current housing or need a transient place... I would like to help. When you reserve with me, you'll have instant friends and be part of a network of 12 homes in the Bay Area.”

### San Francisco’s new [digerati dorms](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackerhome/) appear heavily dependent on Airbnb, using it to handle marketing, booking and payment processing.

At least four dozen Airbnb listings in San Francisco are in these hacker hostels. Many may be violating building codes on numbers of occupants as well as fire-safety regulations, according to the Department of Building Inspection.

HackerHomes says on Airbnb that it has 10 homes in the Bay Area, including four in San Francisco.

**In addition to having 28 listings in San Francisco, there are numerous listings in Silicone Valley, such as:**

In Sunnyvale: [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/937489](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/937489)

In Cupertino: [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2159609](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2159609) HackerHome - 1 mile 2 Infinity Loop

### _A former tenant of Vic recently wrote:_

“I've know Vic for almost 10 years now. He was my previous landlord in the US and always very attentive and helpful. I look forward to hanging out with him in Taiwan soon. He's quite versatile. You can chew the fat with him or be laconic. Either way, you'll have a good time with Big Vic.”
