MICHAEL R. HARRISON
-------------------

On Wednesday April 2nd, 2014,  members of Eviction Free San Francisco marched from the [24th Street Bart Plaza to Vanguard Properties,](#) on 21st and Mission Street. Co-founder of Vanguard Properties Michael Harrison is currently using the Ellis Act to attempt and evict long-term tenant and native San Franciscan [Benito Santiago](http://newamericamedia.org/2014/03/bullied-by-the-system-filipino-american-senior-fights-eviction.php). Read about the march from [Mission Loc@l here](https://missionlocal.org/2014/04/eviction-protest-marches-to-vanguards-doors/.). 

[Read more about Benito here](http://newamericamedia.org/2014/03/bullied-by-the-system-filipino-american-senior-fights-eviction.php). 

We also made [Fox News](http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3423055190001/silicon-valley-vs-the-99/#sp=show-clips).

**Benito Santiago is a senior and disabled Filipino resident of the Duboce Triangle.** He was born and raised in San Francisco. Benito is a teacher for the San Francisco unified school district where he is a music instructor for special-needs children. He received his first eviction notice the day before Thanksgiving, on November 24th 2013. He was offered a $24,000 buyout, which he refused. On December 27th, he got his second eviction notice. Since then, Benito has been organizing with Eviction Free San Francisco to fight his eviction. “I’ll stay here, meeting the challenge instead of turning around and exiting. It’s not just for me. I’m doing this for seniors and those with disabilities,” he says.

**Michael Harrison is the co-founder of Vanguard Properties, where he specializes in “residential investment properties.”** He is a property flipper: his shell company Pineapple Boy LLC bought the building in November 2013 and tried to evict Benito and the two other tenants immediately.  Vanguard Properties is currently involved in a number of luxury property developments in the Mission District and Duboce Triangle area including the development at 19th and Valencia that in February 2014 set record sale prices for the neighborhood. 

**Michael Harrison has Ellis Acted the following:**

*   **336 Chestnut Street**, 2 units, 2/2/2001. Petition L010267.
    
*   **3101 - 3103 Jackson Street**, 7 units, 6/17/2010. Petition L100736.
    
*   **149-151 Duboce Ave**, 4 units, 12/20/2013. Petition L132029.
    

He also sold  **3030 Franklin Street** to  James Meigs Rauh, Jr.\\  
Joelle Rauh on 9/12/2012, who then Ellis Acted the 2 units.

**Mike Harrison is a co-founder and a managing partner of Vanguard Properties.** Over the past 30 years, he has provided hundreds of clients with an in-depth understanding and appreciation of the Bay Area's complex real estate market. Mike's primary focus is residential investment property; additionally, he has extensive experience in residential sales, renovation/development projects, and portfolio analysis and restructuring. He has personally been involved in several dozen renovation and investment projects and has guided many clients in building and diversifying their real estate portfolios over the years. His reputation within the industry is unmatched. He works diligently as an advocate for each of his clients and is a skilled negotiator able to keep the lines of communication open between all parties at every stage of a transaction. Mike is a consistent producer--even in the toughest of markets. Mike is a Bay Area native. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and anthropology from University of California, Berkeley. He is a member of the National Association of Realtors, California Association of Realtors, San Francisco Association of Realtors, Marin Board of Realtors, and Tahoe Sierra Board of Realtors. In his free time he enjoys skiing, sailing, golf, reading, and spending time with his family.
