Â Wedgewood
==========

Wedgewood is the California speculator behind the displacement of [Moms4Housing](https://moms4housing.org/). Wedgewood has been buying up hundreds of foreclosed properties throughout California, including 2928 Magnolia Street in Oakland. Moms for Housing has been living in this home, which otherwise has sat vacant for two years. Moms for Housing is a collective of homeless and marginally housed mothers. There are four times as many empty homes in Oakland as there are people without homes. Moms for Housing has grown as a powerful platform throughout the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020. From [disrupting luxury housing advocates such as Scott Wiener](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/07/moms-4-housing-takes-over-press-conference-announcing-new-housing-bill/?fbclid=IwAR2v0XMIllOyFbjg9yT2FjEYxi892siN7nN2boMKMaeUiBdCSWtmfo-AUMA), to [organizing massive demonstrations in defense of their home](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/1/14/oakland_california_moms_4_housing), Moms for Housing has proven a powerful force. Moms for Housing was [evicted from 2928 Magnolia Street on 1/14/20](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Homeless-mothers-evicted-from-Oakland-home-in-14973659.php), but the struggle against real estate speculation continues.
