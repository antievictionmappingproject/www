**THE LEMBI EMPIRE**
--------------------

In its previous incarnation as CitiApartments and Lembi properties, this company made headlines with “_a stunning array of unlawful business and tenant harassment practices”_ during the lawsuit and subsequent injunction obtained by City Attorney Herrera.  Known for his interlocking web of companies that included Skyline Realty, Lembi monopolized the apartment market, buying up, for example, every large residential property offered for sale in November, 2006.  After paying bloated prices - sometimes 16x the asking price, the Lembi empire would dispatch armed security guards to harass tenants in order to scare them out of their rent-controlled apartments.  Tactics included breaking into apartments, shutting off utilities, changing locks, and retaliating against those who refuse to take buy-outs.

A pioneer in the growing practice of eviction through construction, many of the renovations in the large buildings were done without permits. After coercing long term tenants to vacate their units, and ignoring permitting regulations for renovations, Lembi increased rents exponentially in his vast array of buildings.

By 2011, [the vast Lembi empire was in default](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Walter-Lembi-s-empire-sets-off-investor-frenzy-2367788.php).   LNR, a subsidiary of the Lennar Company, [acquired](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2011/09/area-lands-lembi-portfolio-for-596.html) and resold the Lembi properties to investment groups such as Prado Group, Area Property Partners, Woodmont Company, and CIM Group. [Many of the former Lembi properties](https://www.cmalert.com/search.pl?ARTICLE=164965) are now controlled by Veritas LLC, a company founded by investor Yat-Pang Au, [considered](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-06/21/content_16643650.htm) [one of the largest owners and operators of apartments in San Francisco.](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-06/21/content_16643650.htm)   Through Russian Hill Associates, Mr. Au displaced tenants with Ellis evictions at 1725 Hyde St and 1355 Lombard.
