As part of our work to document tenant experiences and stories around gentrification, displacement and resistance, The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project is documenting tenant-landlord communication during this time. We believe that these communications are important to document to capture what tenants are facing as we move through a global pandemic.

Please submit your communications with your landlord about anything related to: your tenancy, paying rent, not paying rent, repairs, COVID-19, etc. by filling out [THIS FORM](https://airtable.com/shrHbY2q4ZmFtkB9d)**.** Please email antievictionmap@riseup.net with any questions.

[Submit your landlord's response here](https://airtable.com/shrHbY2q4ZmFtkB9d)

Please check out our COVID-19 Emergency Tenant Protections Map to learn more about what protections you might have right now: https://www.antievictionmap.com/covid.

If you'd like to submit stories about your rent strike or be connected to others striking with similar landlords or locales, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzMYs_BZYFb601oiAGtotfTX7tjZXvao3F0PHuTlko4rAxKA/viewform).
