**Robert Arthur Imhoff and Landmark Realty**
============================================

_Notorious Mission District landlord Robert Imhoff has filed Ellis Act eviction notices at a 12-unit building on 3301-3311 Cesar Chavez Street (at South Van Ness). The mass evictions primarily target Latino families and include a tenant who has lived in their home since 1969._

[Randy Shaw reports, "Imhoff has always been a secretive man. You can find few if any photos that show his identity. The late Victor Miller of the New Mission News and reporter Brian Doohan spent years exposing Imhoff’s wrong, which were primarily based on substandard housing. . .  The mass evictions at 3301-3311 will likely raise Imhoff’s public figure. Based on records filed with the Rent Board, 25 tenants face displacement."](http://www.beyondchron.org/new-mass-ellis-evictions-hit-mission/)

Evictions
=========

### Ellis Act: 3301-3311 Cesar Chavez Street LLC: 2/26/2015

[Notorious Mission District landlord Robert Imhoff has filed Ellis Act eviction notices at a 12-unit building on 3301-3311 Cesar Chavez Street (at South Van Ness). The mass evictions primarily targets Latino families and include a tenant who has lived in their home since 1969.](http://www.beyondchron.org/new-mass-ellis-evictions-hit-mission/)

### Buyout:  Guerrero/ 22nd: 10/29/2012

A tenant who had been living there since 1995 wrote to us: “The landlord originally offered to buy me out of my lease and give me 6 months to move out. I saw a lawyer they came back with a very high counter offer and the landlord told me that I would get nothing, that he would Ellis the building instead. This was six months ago and I have not heard from him again about it, but I live in fear all the time that he will do something to get me out of my home.”

### _Harassment: 2402a Harrison St_: _2/5/2014_

Imhoff claimed non payment of rent  and administered unfair late fees without notifying a family and people with disabilities.

### 250 Taylor Street: 1987

Imhoff Illegally evicted low-income Filipino families from the building in 1987 during a wave of gentrification. [This inspired a Homes Not Jails action in 1992.](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Homes+Not+Jails.-a015890041) Imhoff was seeking to evict all tenants for substantial rehabilitation, [which would have exempted the building from rent control. He ended up having to give the tenants the option to return after repairs were made, along with a sizable relocation payment.](http://www.beyondchron.org/new-mass-ellis-evictions-hit-mission/)

### Fires and Death: 641 O'Farrell Street: 1997

[14 blazes have been reported in the 97-unit building](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Crackdown-on-O-Farrell-Street-3122461.php). Records show 21 fire code violations at the 90-year-old building since July 1989. Imhoff paid nearly $4 million for the building in 1988, and has since been unresponsive. [Barbara Hersel](http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Barbara+Hersel%22), 38, burned to death Jan. 3rd, 1997. Records show that problems have been addressed after authorities identified them. Imhoff's lawyer said that "[his client is law-abiding but disinclined to talk to reporters. He also said that Imhoff, who owns hundreds of apartment units in The City, shouldn't be held responsible for social problems at 641 O'Farrell "that need to be addressed by society as a whole."](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Crackdown-on-O-Farrell-Street-3122461.php)"
