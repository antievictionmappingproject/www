(Dis)location is a multi-platform publication and public workshop series centered around the issue of local housing justice. The first chapter, Black Exodus, builds upon the Anti-Eviction Mapping project's commitment to centering communities as producers of social and historical knowledge. Activated by the unprecedented out-migration of Black San Franciscans from their historic neighborhoods, our aim with this project has been to foreground Black storytelling and art-making.
