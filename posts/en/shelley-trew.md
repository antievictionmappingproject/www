July 2016

"The protesters accused real estate agent Shelley Trew of “fraud, elder abuse, and greed” for coercing the 76-year-old owner of the house at 117 Ripley St. into signing over the rights to her family home in 2013. The elderly woman, they said, signed the contract after Trew offered to help her “find out how much her house is worth,” but was unaware that its stipulations included the sale and evictions of herself and some nine tenants.

“She is being railroaded,” said the owner’s nice, Nancy Pili Hernandez, a Mission muralist and the youth program manager at the Good Samaritan Resource Center, who also lives at 117 Ripley St. “This contract should have never been signed because she was not aware of what that contract said.”

“\[Trew\] lied about what the paper said that she initially signed,” said Pili Hernandez, adding that  the house’s perspective buyer is currently suing her aunt for breach of contract for not going through with the sale."
