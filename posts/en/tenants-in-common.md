Members of the Los Angeles Tenants Union North East local teamed up with The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project to create a counter-narrative _by_ and _for_ tenants who are experiencing and resisting displacement. We seek to move beyond defining our neighbors by their eviction story, and more fully capture their experience of being a tenant in our community. We want to document how it feels to live in Los Angeles -- the smell on your block, what it feels like to walk down the street, what it means to know neighbors. In essence, what it feels like to be part of the fabric of Los Angeles. Documenting these stories of power, resistance, and strength attempts to provide a whole story of displacement in Los Angeles, but most importantly to encapsulate what living and fighting to stay in our city feels like.
