We Are Here: Oral Histories, San Francisco
==========================================

In 2015, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project released its new zine project, [_We Are Here_.](https://archive.org/details/aempzinepaginated) The zine features a collection of interviews, essays, poetry and images that reflect a moment in San Francisco history. Among the centuries-long history of arrivals, settlements, departures and displacements that this place holds, we wanted to give voice to what is alternately dubbed, “the housing crisis,” “the tech boom,” or “hypergentrification.” No anthology can possibly contain all the stories and experiences that meet within the city limits. Here, we simply present the narratives that we have encountered thus far. We want to let these offerings speak for themselves, but also reflect our hope for community empowerment as this city is increasingly claimed by capital - and not for the first time. Multiple people have worked on this zine, though we would especially like to thank Marko Muir, Karyn Smoot, Carly Wais, Andrew Szeto, Manon Vergerio, Manissa Maharawal, and Erin McElroy
