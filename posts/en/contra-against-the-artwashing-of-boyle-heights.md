Contra-Against the Artwashing of Boyle Heights
----------------------------------------------

A Project by B.H.A.A.A.D. in collaboration with the AEMP
--------------------------------------------------------

This project is a compilation of maps, artifacts and narratives on galleries detailing the ongoing fight against artwashing and displacement in Boyle Heights, drawn from the archive of the Boyle Heights Alliance Against Artwashing and Displacement. We write this in the middle of the COVID 19 pandemic with 491,000 households bracing to fight against potential evictions when LA’s moratoriums expire. The struggle for housing in LA will now face a wave of further pressure and speculation by city and private developers — no doubt some will once again use art and gallery space as their entry into working class neighborhoods.
