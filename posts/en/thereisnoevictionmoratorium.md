There Is No Eviction Moratorium

**Since Mayor Eric Garcetti declared a state of emergency on March 15, 2020, LA landlords have filed over 10,000 evictions against tenants.**

### First, we want to make visible the extent of eviction filings that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each case represents a rental unit housing individuals and families who faced eviction during a global pandemic.

### Second, this map is a testament to elected officials’ inaction in the midst of human loss and economic devastation that are without precedent over the past 100 years. Each of these evictions represents a policy failure, cowardice when tenants needed elected officials the most.

### Abolish eviction and join your local tenant union!

### The patchwork of laws and ordinances championed by elected officials as moratoria was anything but. **Since Mayor Eric Garcetti declared a state of emergency on March 15, 2020, LA landlords have filed over 10,000 evictions against tenants.**

### The closest thing to a moratorium came at the pandemic’s beginning from the Judicial Council of California, called Emergency Rule 1, which prevented courts from processing evictions based on non-payment of rent from April 6 - October 5, 2020.

### During this time, California’s Judicial Council all but begged Governor Gavin Newsom, the California state legislature, and local governments to codify meaningful eviction moratoria once these temporary protections expired.  The resulting efforts not only did little to strengthen existing tenant protections, but also failed to live up to claims of an eviction moratorium. 

### In LA, eviction case filings increased 175% once Rule 1 was lifted. .Thousands of tenants faced an impossible decision, between losing their housing and attending in-person court hearings while the Center for Disease Control advised against indoor gatherings to limit the pandemic’s spread. Tenant organizers continue to report cases of tenants who were evicted because they believed there to be a moratorium in place.

### And as the state legislature waffles on extending Senate Bill 91, let alone enacting an actual eviction moratorium, a devastating eviction crisis that once looked avoidable looms once again.
