FERGUS O'SULLIVAN
-----------------

### Note: There are two people named Fergus O'Sullivan in San Francisco.  The Fergus O'Sullivan of Fosco.biz is **not an evictor**

### The other Fergus O'Sullivan is President at [FOS COMPANY](http://www.foscompany.com/). He manages a number of LLCs. andis notorious for using various tools to displace tenants - Ellis evictions, OMI, "eviction through construction," buy-outs and threats.  He lists at least one of the units at an address that he displaced tenants through an OMI eviction on AirBnb, and has offered many of his properties as short term rentals at other times.   After buyouts and evictions, [units are sometimes turned into "hacker hotels"](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/02/san-francisco-hacker-homes-landlord-fergus-o-sullivan/)

### In 2015 he lined up investors to purchase a mansion on Fell Street, and is now in the "commune" business with ["Chateau Ubuntu"](http://sf.curbed.com/2016/7/1/12082250/Millennial-commune-alamo-square-fell-street)

### In 2006,  at his construction site, [a wall collapsed and killed a worker](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/citations-handed-down-in-wall-collapse/Content?oid=2157776).

### O'Sullivan has a [large development project in the Sunset District](http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/massive-mixed-use-development-near-ocean-beach-back-on-track/Content?oid=2922457)

Recently, we received this letter about his short term rental business:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Hello,

On May 15th I moved to 2870A Harrison St, which is owned by Fergus O'Sullivan. I initially booked 30 days through Airbnb, and was asked to sign a lease if I wanted to stay longer. For the first few weeks I was the only tenant in the 4 bedroom apartment.

I later found out from the property manager the he was not even sure if it was legal to rent me the room, because there was still construction on my floor for weeks. To this day there are still covers over the smoke detectors.

I agreed to sign a 6 month lease for my room. The property manager told me the lease would show the full amount of rent for the floor ($8,400/mo), but not to worry about it. He said he would give me a lease for the correct amount ($2,100/mo) once it was prepared.

I told the property manager I was not comfortable signing the lease, but he gave me no other choice.

Once I signed the lease he told me he was going to give me $8400 in cash, I had to deposit it in my bank account, and I had to write a check for the same amount to the landlord. He told me this would be used to make it look like I was renting the entire floor to influence the bank's financing (which sounds like fraud). They finally gave me the real lease agreement, and I signed it.

The floor has 2 single rooms and 2 double rooms. After talking with new tenants, I found out that the landlord is now charging up to $2500/mo for each bed in the double rooms. This means that the landlord is making around $10,000/mo.

After dealing with this uncomfortable situation and finding out that Fergus O'Sullivan evicted the tenants of 2870 Harrison, I found an apartment to move to August 1st. I notified the property manager in an attempt to get another tenant in my room before that date.

After I found your site, I reported an illegal vacation rental on my floor. The property manager rented out one of the rooms for 2 weeks in June, but assured us that it would never happen again."

**He is also** [AirBnBing 2455-59 Lombard Street](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2007468).

### We received another letter from a tenant being displaced by O'Sullivan recently too.

I lived in my place for 20 years.  My landlady died in 2012. A stranger bought my place, did not furnish proof of who he was, made an  
offer to buy me out in July 2012.  I refused and was served an unlawful detainer complaint the following week. The plaintiff in my case named a co-defendant who did not even reside at the address, limited my ability to respond, and contradicts the inventory taken by the real-estate agent.  The plaintiff in the case got a default judgement, locked me out of my place on September 5, 2012, kept all of my assets (family photos, furniture, my wedding ring, recipes, academic/professional tools, etc...) and I was made homeless as a result.  I am on a fixed income, have disabling HIV/AIDS, and am currently seeking a Motion to Vacate the default judgement based upon the grounds that the court had sufficient evidentiary support to negate the plaintiff's claims.  The court was and has been notified from the onset.

When the plaintiff initiated these proceedings, there were four of his attorneys to just myself.  Legal retainer for representation has been  
incredibly difficult and overwhelmed by the number of evictions happening in San Francisco.  His representation has been Bornstein &  
Bornstein.

This is currently ongoing and I need your support, San Francisco.  The case will be going back to court and my aim will be to maintain support  
during my case and keep a public spotlight on these hearings. 

### O'Sullivan has evicted:

**1142-1146 York Street:** 4 units Ellised on 6/4/2013 by Fergus O'Sullivan, Michael Heath, and 1142 York Street, LLC. Petition L130873

**1080-1090 South Van Ness:** 4 Units harassed, offered buy-outs, and OMI eviction on 1/23/2014 by Fergus O'Sullivan. A tenant recently wrote to us: "Our building was in escrow for six months. Now, the new landlord is trying to buy us out. He has a history of tenant harassment. He's already threatened owner move-ins to a few tenants. Many of the tenants in this six unit building don't speak English and are intimidated by him. Some tenants have been in their units since the mid-70s."  [This building made the news when it was found that there were bunk beds for rent for $1800/month in crowded rooms that violate building codes.](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/02/san-francisco-hacker-homes-landlord-fergus-o-sullivan/)

**2870-2878 Harrison St.** 9 units that house over 50 adults and 20 children were threatened with an Ellis Act in June 2013. [Many of these families have lived in the building for more than 25 years and for many of the children and youth, this is the only home they have ever known. Fergus O'Sullivan, bought the building in June and two weeks later sent all the units buy-out offers and threats that they would be served with an Ellis Act eviction if they didn't take the money. The tenants were scared, and many of them being monolingual Spanish speakers thought that this letter was an eviction notice.](http://:http://cjjc.org/en/news/51-housing-justice/558-harrison-st-tenants-protest-harassment)  After displacing tenants, a unit re-appeared on the rental market for $8000/month.

**2455 Lombard Street** - OMI on Silvia Sotomayor on 2/14/2014 for his brother Paul to move in. He is currently [AirBnBing 2455-59 Lombard Street](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2007468).
