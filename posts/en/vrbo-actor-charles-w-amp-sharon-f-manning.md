**CHARLES W. & SHARON F. MANNING -** **Manning Properties LLC**
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Mannings permanently reside in Nashville, TN. Charles is the Chancellor of the University of West Virginia System and Tennessee Board of Regents in Nashville. His wife describes him as “a very gentle and gracious man who cares deeply about education. Yet with state resources strained to the limit these days, public education is a highly politicized enterprise, with increasing competition for decreasing dollars.”

So after enacting those tough austerity cuts on the students, Sharon “whisk(s) Charles out to San Francisco for a little break.” (To one of six homes.) - VRBO listing #388407
