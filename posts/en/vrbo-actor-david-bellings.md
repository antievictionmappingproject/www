**DAVID BELLINGS**
------------------

### David Bellings advertises himself as the “Top 1%”. He is an attorney, real estate agent and broker who specializes in condo conversions and “luxury transactions”. With over 20 properties of his own in San Francisco, he is known to have converted residential units into short term vacation rentals, including:

*   15-21 Tuscany Alley, a 4 unit building - every unit in the building was offered as a  vacation rental
*   525 Filbert St, 6 unit building. Purchased by Bellings in 2004, at least 3 units are now listed on VRBO as vacation rentals at $395-$495 per night.

Regarding 15-21 Tuscany Alley, Bellings admitted in an email his guests may not make the best neighbors: “There have been instances where some guests have disturbed the other occupants in the building. Please ignore this if it does not apply to you and is also not meant to apply to babies and small children who are welcome.”

In July 2014, protesters and the San Francisco Tenants Union put a sticker notifying Bellings he was in violation of the short-term rental prohibition.

He was undeterred and his listings continue: [http://www.vrbo.com/562168](http://www.vrbo.com/562168)
