According to her [website,](http://www.metropolitanprop.com/About_Nina.html) “Nina is an expert in TIC transactions. She can guide clients through the DRE public report process, understands the complexities of TIC agreements, group vs. fractional loans and condominium conversion. Having worked with TICs since 2003, she has been at the forefront of the proliferation of this form of ownership."

A long-time neighbor noticed that tenants of all four units at 451 Tehama were removed recently.

The four apartments were soon afterward furnished and available full time on VRBO where she charged between $459-599 per night.   The "host" wasBernat Pons of [come2sf.com](http://www.come2sf.com).  Being a middle man property manager for illegal rentals is big business for Pons. He was recently interviewed and acknowledge that San Francisco did not allow short-term rentals so stated:

“With all these new revelations like the (proposed) law by (San Francisco Supervisor) David Chiu, I prefer to be on the low-key side,” he said. “We are going to look for another kind of rentals, more like long-term.”

Pons also lists properties for short term rental which he owns himself, including a building purchased in a foreclosure sale--one family’s pain is Bernat Pons’ gain.
