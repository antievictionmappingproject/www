<h1>Invitation Homes, Sacramento, 2018</h1>
<p>
  Invitation Homes is a subsidiary of the 434 billion dollar company (as of
  December 2017),
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group" target="_blank"
    >The Blackstone Group.</a
  >
  Launched in 2012 as Blackstone began acquiring foreclosed single family homes,
  Invitation has since moved into multi-family properties. After a 2017 IPO,
  Invitation now trades on the New York Stock Exchange.

  Sacramento neighborhoods were hit hard by the

  which created an opportunity for companies like Blackstone and

  to acquire single family homes at rock bottom prices. After the 2017 merger of
  Colony, Starwood and Waypoint with Invitation Homes, the company held 82,000
  single family homes.

    >“REO to Rental” report</a
  >, the entrance of Wall Street companies into the market for single family
  homes cause many levels of harm and instability to communities, raising issues
  of displacement, lack of home-ownership opportunities, and troubling fair
  housing issues. A recent study of affordable homes in New York showed that

    >most affordable homes are purchased by cash buyers</a

  a home.

  and investigated for

    target="_blank"
    >negligence</a
  >, Invitation is able to operate in the Sacramento market unfettered by any
  eviction or just cause protections or rent control laws. The California state
  law that is, in 2018, being challenged by Proposition 10, also protects single
  family homes from local rent control ordinances.

  The Sacramento County Employees Retirement System is invested in Invitation
  Homes. As

  financial base.
</p>
<p>
  Invitation’s holdings bring profits to its executives and investors, raising
  rents at will and causing community instability. Under California’s
  Proposition 13, mergers and transfers such as the Colony Starwood sale to
  Blackstone/Invitation change actual ownership, but maintain tax rates at low
  foreclosure crisis prices. An random example on the map below below is a
  single family home on Sandylee Way, purchased in 2005 for $302,000. Foreclosed
  in 2012 by JP Morgan Chase, Invitation Homes acquired the home for $150,000
  and bundled it in a security offered by Wells Fargo Bank in 2017. Sacramento
  County collects property taxes based on the 2012 purchase price, a value of
  less than half what it was in 2005, while Invitation keeps the house off of
  the market for other homeowners, destabilizing the community with rent hikes
  and turnover and depriving the County of assessment income.
</p>
<p>
  According to Sacramento County Court data, Invitation Homes filed at least 156
  unlawful detainers (the last stage of an eviction) between 2015 and 2017.
  Invitation owns approximately 2000 properties in Sacramento County.
