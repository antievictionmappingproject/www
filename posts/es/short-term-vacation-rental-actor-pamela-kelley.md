**PAMELA KELLEY**
-----------------

Pamela Kelley, a real estate agent, began her short-term rental business by promising her own landlord, Harold Wong, that she would give up her rent-controlled apartment if she could rent it out year-round as a vacation rental, for a percent of the profits. A unit she paid $2100 for could earn up to $6700.

She spoke about her business to the [New York Times in 2011](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/us/22bchomes.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), which noted in the article that:

"Such conversions are largely illegal under San Francisco’s rent-control laws, but according to census figures released last month, the practice of converting private residences into what are effectively hotels is widespread. In some popular San Francisco neighborhoods, there are now more housing units dedicated to “seasonal, recreational or occasional use” than there are available apartments for rent."

[Her website](http://www.home2sanfrancisco.com/collection)  lists 17 furnished luxury rentals.  Her properties were originally available for nightly stays, but now advertise 30 day minimums.   Ms. Kelley claims that her business is legal and ethical.
