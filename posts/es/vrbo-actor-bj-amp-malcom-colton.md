BJ & MALCOLM COLTON **& their Shar-Pei dog**
--------------------------------------------

“BJ is a leading realtor who has for many years lived and specialized in Noe Valley. Her husband Malcolm is a marketing executive in a software company. They and their 16-year-old Shar Pei, Zelda, split their time between Noe Valley and the Sonoma wine country. “ - hosts words from VRBO listing of 4 units at 4120 24th Street.

BJ (Betty J Droubi) attracted our attention with her market-driven description of the neighborhood. Clearly their building purchase is an investment in a trendy neighborhood rather than a commitment to a community they dreamt of and saved their whole lives for.

BJ writes:

“Noe Valley is one of the most sought after addresses in San Francisco among young professionals. A typical walker on the street has a dog and a toddler in tow, and works at Google or Zynga. Noe Valley has a pretty good San Francisco climate, avoiding the worst of the summer fog, and is central to everything without being high density city living.”

The Colton’s listed 8 vacation units on VRBO between San Francisco and Sonoma. We tracked Colton’s activity over time. Over the 16 months, the average monthly rent for a 2 bedroom in Noe Valley increased 11% to  $4084 according to [myapartmentmap.com](http://www.myapartmentmap.com)

*   BJ and Malcolm’s rental prices also increased over this time from $1600 to $2000 per week though their costs as owners did not increase.
    
*   Their nightly rate increased from $275 in 2012 to $325 in 2013—18% increase.
    
*   If we assume most tourists rent by the week for their discounted weekly rate of $2000, they will earn $32,000 in the next 4 months ($8000 per month /$128000 per year)
    
*   This is 195% what market rate tenants would pay.
    
*   A calendar booked with consecutive shorter stays earns the owners even more money as they are requesting $325-$375 a night ($2275-$2625 per week)
    
*   This is only one unit and they are renting out three other units in the building at 4120 24th St.
