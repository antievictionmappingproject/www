JACK HALPRIN
============

We send our condolences to Jack Halprin's family and friends in this time of grief.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On February 26th, 2014, Jack Halprin, head of eDiscovery, Enterprise for Google, issued Ellis Act evictions for four of the 7 units at 812 Guerrero Street. After moving into the building two years ago, he issued an OMI eviction on another unit through an alleged partner's name, Daniel Jay Ortiz, unbeknownst to him. Susan, who was displaced and forced to relocate to the East Bay, is now engaged in a lawsuit against Jack.

Currently being Ellis Act evicted are:

*   Claudia Triado, a third grade teacher at Fairmount Elementary in San Francisco who lives there with her two-year-old son and parter who drives taxis.
*   Evan Wolkenstein, a teacher at Jewish Community High School.
*   Johnny Tripod, an artist and community member.
*   And a woman with a disability who wishes to remain anonymous.

On April 11, 2014, tenants and Eviction Free San Francisco organized a Google Bus blockade, stopping a bus at 18th and Dolores, demanding that Google pressure Jack in rescinding the eviction immediately. 

[Mission Local](http://missionlocal.org/2014/04/protesters-gather-at-google-lawyers-apartment-house/) reported:

“He is so fake, he had this plan all along,” said Claudia Tirado, one of Halprin’s tenants, a third grade teacher and mother of a small child who has lived in the building for eight years. “He bought it with a partner taking two flats, now he’s taking all seven.”

“Why doesn’t he buy a regular house, why does he have to take seven units off the rental market,” said a seemingly tearful Tirado, to a crowd gathering on 19th and Dolores in anticipation of blockading a Google bus. “When Jack Halprin moved in two years ago, he saw me and my baby, he knew who he was kicking out.”

For the protest’s organizers, the case of 812 Guerrero demonstrates the clear link between the tech giant’s presence in San Francisco and the rise in evictions.

“Google is actually evicting people,” said McElroy to the crowd, referring to Halprin. “We’re demanding that Google put pressure on Jack Halprin to rescind these evictions.”

After police officers ushered demonstrators out of the Google bus’ path, the march moved up Guerrero Street towards the house in question. Protest organizers as well Tirado and her fellow tenants moved up the steps of the building and spoke to the crowd through a megaphone.

Evan Wolkenstein, a teacher at the Jewish Community High School of the Bay who is also being evicted from his $1,700 a month one-bedroom apartment, added: “He feels so empowered and he can do what he wants.”

“I’ve lived here for eight years. This is my home. I love this building and I love the people in it,” said Evan Wolkenstein, a tenant in the building and a teacher at Jewish Community High School. “We had a community where we knew each other…what was once a community of friends has become a piece of property to be traded and sold for money.”

Tirado emerged from her apartment, accompanied by her young son, and held up a portrait of her family to show the crowd.

“I want to stay here, my baby was born here,” Tirado said. “Jack Halprin, you don’t need seven units!”

According to his Google Hangout profile, his tagline is "eDiscovery and Information Governance Specialist, Recovering Litigator and Road Warrior." And, he is into "Google Apps Vault, information governance, data management, the preservation obligation and compliance related issues are my work related passions...Outside of that, you'll have to ask for more information!"

Jack Halprin's Summary (from LinkedIn)
--------------------------------------

"I work to ensure the legal team has the tools, technology and capabilities to ensure discovery obligations are met. I also serve as a member of the team working on the internal records management and information governance program. In addition to these responsibilities, I focus on building a common strategy to manage eDiscovery and governance across all Google’s product lines.

"As an attorney and former private-practice litigator, I focus on the challenges organizations have managing electronically stored information (ESI) for both legal and information governance purposes. With close to 7 years experience in the Information Governance and eDiscovery spaces, my interests include managing social media for legal and governance purposes, defensible processes for managing discovery, proportionality, and the reduction of eDiscovery costs. I frequently speak and write on social media discovery and governance, best practices for legal hold and the preservation obligation, defensibility of search technology, return on investment, and the movement of enterprise data to the cloud.  
  
I am a strategic and visionary thinker with a diverse range of experiences that enable me to communicate effectively across all levels of an organization, understand and solve complex issues, manage P&L and budget, and motivate teams to exceed their goals. I have experience creating a startup division that was profitable in less than three years and helping established businesses increase market share, revenue, profitability, and brand awareness.  
  
I am active in industry organizations including The Sedona Conference, EDRM, and the ACC. My prior experience includes litigation, senior product manager/marketing manager in the enterprise software sector, and discovery consultant for corporate counsel.
