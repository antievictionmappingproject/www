**THOMAS IVELI and BOB SIGMUND**
--------------------------------

**In October 2001, infamous landlords Thomas Iveli and Bob Sigmund** of [Baychester Shopping Center West, Inc.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/baychester-shopping-center-west-inc/43775551.aspx) and [400 W. 22 St. Corp.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/400-w-22-st-corp/43246525.aspx) were found guilty of multiple counts of tenant harassment in nine buildings in New York along the two blocks of West 22d Street between Eighth and Tenth Avenues. They had owned ten buildings there: 327, 329, 331, 337, 400, 402, 406, 410, 412 and 442 West 22d. It had been a three-year lawsuit. [They were subsequently barred from owning property in New York City following the case](http://www.tenant.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=2009&sid=871d3d7104ea5802b3424813727f36d4), originally filed by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal in 1998. They have since moved to San Francisco where Iveli owns and Sigmund manages a number of buildings through [Norcal Ventures, Inc.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/norcal-ventures-inc/43299520.aspx), [Norcal Holdings, LLC](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/norcal-holdings-llc/52138473.aspx) and the [406-10-12 Realty Corp.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/406-10-12-realty-corp/43246530.aspx) They have treated their tenants horrendously, as the displayed Yelp reviews attest to.

**They have also Ellis Acted 15 units in three properties:**

*   **359-363 Waller St.** (6 units) – Petition L040839, July 9, 2004. By [406-10-12 Realty Corp.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/406-10-12-realty-corp/43246530.aspx), a New York Corporation, [Baychester Shopping Center West, Inc.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/baychester-shopping-center-west-inc/43775551.aspx), and Thomas Iveli.
*   **2341-43 Jackson St.**  (2 units) – Petition L2K1865, August 30, 2000.  The whole building sold in 2002 for $161,000 profit. By [Norcal Ventures, Inc.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/norcal-ventures-inc/43299520.aspx)
*   [**1100-1112 Montgomery St.** (7 units) – Petition L992464, November 29, 1999.  The hole 7 unit building sold 4 months later. By](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/norcal-ventures-inc/43299520.aspx) [406-10-12 Realty Corp.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/406-10-12-realty-corp/43246530.aspx)

_**Sigmund is listed as Property Manager for many buildings that Iveli owns.**_ 

[Previously, in 1997,](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/nyregion/a-fight-without-victors.html) [Sigmund served a 60-day sentence arising from an incident in which he is accused of striking a photographer invited by tenants to take pictures of conditions in their apartments.](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/nyregion/a-fight-without-victors.html)

[Deborah Boatright, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, called Sigmund and Iveli “problem landlords.” One of their tenants, Ms. Wheeler, described, “I've suffered tremendously, my family has suffered, my relationship has suffered.'' She reported having nightmares about them.](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/nyregion/a-fight-without-victors.html)

**In 1994 Sigmund entered the apartment of a tenant who had died from AIDS before his family arrived and stole three bags of property and was arrested.** [Richard Hanson of the Chelsea Coalition on Housing, a tenant-advocacy group, said Mr. Sigmund exploits AIDS programs by housing patients in inferior dwellings at high rents](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chelsea-a-hated-landlord-in-hot-water.html). Kernan Huttick, who also had AIDS and lived at 406 West 22d saw Mr. Sigmund break into the dead man's apartment and emerge with three stuffed bags. Huttick explained that then, when the brother of the deceased man came after the man had died, he was found crying on the bed, saying, 'There's nothing here -- what happened to my brother's stuff?”

In 1993, Sigmund and Iveli, paid $42,000 in fines for illegally converting an S.R.O. into apartments as well as for construction without a permit, illegal occupancy and nuisance violations in the mid-1980's at 334-6 West 22d Street. [State Supreme Court Justice Bruce Wright wrote, "The various devices, tricks and ploys invoked and invented by the defendants to avoid judgment are patently transparent efforts to deter, delay and hinder due process."](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chelsea-a-hated-landlord-in-hot-water.html)
