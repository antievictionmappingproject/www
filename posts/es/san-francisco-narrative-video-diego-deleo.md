Made in collaboration with SOTA

Diego DeLeo, a poet and long time North Beach resident, faces eviction. Diego is still fighting his eviction. Please support his campaign. This video was produced in collaboration with the San Francisco Ruth Assawa School of the Arts. The interview was shot by Rebecca Gourevitch of the AEMP for her amazing short 'Holding Out', with additional photography and editing by students Reign Lafraniere and Saoirse Brownfield Magee.
