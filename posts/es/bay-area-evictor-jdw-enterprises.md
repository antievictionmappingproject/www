JDW Enterprises
===============

Justin Douglas Wallway has been using the Substantial Rehab rent control loophole to attempt to displace Oakland tenants.  Funded by First Republic Bank and enabled by the City government of Oakland, JDW has inspired his tenants to organize to stop him.  He has a history of evictions and home flipping, with partner Caleb Inman, serving at least 24 notices in a 5 year period and reselling a foreclosed home in 2009 for a 300% profit in 2 months.

The [JDW Tenants’ Association](https://www.facebook.com/JDWtenantsassociation/) members inhabit 13 buildings which Wallway is attempting to exempt from rent control.  There are many loopholes in Oakland's rent control laws, but JDW’s current weapon of choice is Substantial Rehabilitation. Normally reserved for decrepit buildings that have been fully refurbished, JDW is claiming this exemption despite the fact that they haven’t done the quantity of upgrades required to qualify. While tenants are hopeful for their upcoming hearing at the Rent Board under the representation of [Centro Legal de La Raza](http://centrolegal.org/) this is one of the many loopholes in Oakland rent control laws that should be forever banished from Oakland's Rent Adjustment Ordinance.  More details in the recent [East Bay Express article](https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/some-oakland-landlords-are-using-a-legal-loophole-to-exempt-housing-from-rent-control/Content?oid=9074126).
