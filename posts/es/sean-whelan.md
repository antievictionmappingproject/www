### **[Andrew Zacks, Whelan’s attorney thinks the mayor is a “tenants’ activist.”](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/landlord-groups-argue-sf-laws-favor-tenants/Content?oid=2719121)**

Andrew Zacks, Whelan’s attorney and counsel for the Small Property Owners of San Francisco, which represents landlords with one to four units who generally live in the buildings they rent out (with wife Denise Leadbetter)

_Tenant activists say that Andrew Zacks is a private practice attorney who has marketed the Ellis Act as a way to get rid of tenants. He is the main lawyer involved in evicting elderly tenants. He also owns Ellis buildings and is evicting his own tenants._

_Zacks represents the owners of the Hotel Chronicle, a residential hotel that is home to 16 tenants, many of whom have lived there for decades. The owners are using the Ellis Act to get the tenants out of the building, saying that they want to leave the rental business._

_Zacks also represents the owners of the Astoria Hotel, a 92-room residential hotel that was ordered by the court to stop renting its rooms to tourists. In a similar case, Zacks represents owners of the Cornell Hotel on Bush Street who want to turn almost half of their units from residential units to tourist use. He took their case to the Supreme Court. And he represents the owners of the Remo Hotel in North Beach who want to convert their hotel to tourist use._  
_Under the SF Residential Hotel Conversion Ordinance, residential hotels can't be converted to tourist hotels without a conditional use permit. This ordinance is meant to preserve housing for seniors, disabled people, and low-income people._

DAYCARE DISPUTE IN SQUAW VALLEY:
--------------------------------

KSL abruptly terminated the lease agreement with the Mountain Kids Playcare project. Construction had already begun on the project, which took the form of a 5,000 square foot “sprung construction” temporary building on Squaw Valley property. Mountain Kids owner Sean Whelan says that he will lose $470,000 over the abrupt cancellation of the project. The initial demand letter to KSL demanding payment was rejected.
