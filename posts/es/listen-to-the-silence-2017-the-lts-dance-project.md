Listen to the Silence
---------------------

Listen to the Silence Dance Project is a collaboration between members of the entire Stanford dance community to tell stories that matter to them through their favorite medium -- dance. This year, inspired by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project in San Francisco, the members have brought three of their favorite narratives on eviction to life through dance.
