**Danny Haber and Alon Gutman: Housing Disruptors**
===================================================

Haber and Gutman's  latest "disruptive" business is [oWow.com](https://owow.com/), a developer of tiny shared housing spaces in Oakland, marketed only through Facebook log-in.  Their takeover of the Travellers single room occupancy hotel in Oakland resulted in displacement of all of the long-term  senior and disabled tenants.  [Precarious Housing Map here](http://antievictionmap.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=9f304aa4fe9a4b9087a8decc02416a0c)

### THE WINDS OF THE NEGEV BLOW HOT

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52b7d7a6e4b0b3e376ac8ea2/1467432250406-BVBMUFO1B9SUJ8V1EIMX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFNc3oDJVti_AfKN7832MzJZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpzy2v5VL_Gn87yrYq_alilo7LKjKvt1yQi2P9hI5H3KXzwqcMD1wOk0t_2-uxZjLX8/image-asset.png)

### The Negev followed failed sublettors such as Campus.com in their scalping approach to "communal" living.   First using AirBnb, and later developing their own website, they took living spaces from some of the poorest residents of SRO hotels, as well as artists in Live/Work spaces. The legality of the business model has not been determined, with Haber and Gutman willing to "disrupt" until caught and stopped. The winds of the Negev are hot, and fires have been involved in displacing tenants at at least four of their managed or acquired properties. 

### After being involved in multiple lawsuits in San Francisco, Haber et al moved into Oakland, which has fewer protections for SRO tenants.

### After a large fire displaced the well known AK Press at 674 23rd Street in West Oakland,  [Haber acquired the building](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/former-ak-press-warehouse-sold-to-tech-co-op-developer-who-demolished-1919-market/Content?oid=5060621).  Soon afterward, real estate agent/owner Kim Marienthal sold him the building at 669 24th Street where the fire started.  Haber received funding for the purchase from Seth Jacobson, the owner of 1919 Market Street where long term live/work tenants were abruptly displaced due to the neglected conditions of the building.

### **Properties that the pair own or have managed, causing havoc to existing tenants:**

The Park Hotel at **1040 Folsom** Street was cleared of long term tenants after a fire.  While the tenants were waiting for repairs to be able to move back in, the owner Nasir Patel leased the building to Haber and Gutman, dba The Negev.  Instead of the displaced tenants being contacted to move back into their rooms, The Negev opened as a digerati dorm.  From a Craigslist ad: _$1250 Negev Folsom!:  Family dinners on Sundays, parties every 3 weeks, yoga on Fridays, and weekly talks from well known people mostly in the technology world.“_

671 24th Street and 674 23rd Street
-----------------------------------

AK Press and many other tenants were displaced in the fire that started in the building next door., where two people died in the blaze.  Haber and his financiers - among them, Seth Jacobson - acquired both buildings and have plans to develop "Live Work" spaces at the site.sThe City of Oakland was said to have put up roadblocks as the previous owner attempted to repair the fire damage.  Seth Jacobson was the owner of 1919 Market when the City forced tenants out due to the condition of the building.

### **1040 Folsom**

The Negev Folsom at 1040 Folsom St. was the subject of a lawsuit filed by tenants displaced by a fire there who were not offered their units back at their former rent rate, as required by the San Francisco rent-control ordinance.

### **200 12th Street**  -   The original “Negev” was a live/work space that Haber and Gutman turned into a crowded hostel, offering bunk beds in a shared room for $1250 or more per month.  The beds were offered through AirBnb. The building is owned by the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corp. who originally  had no knowledge of the subrental. The Planning Dept. closed down the illegal short term rental.

The Negev subleases [5 properties in San Francisco](https://www.thenegev.com/#/search/sf) on Hayes, Tehama, 9th Street as well as 6th and Folsom Streets.  They also list properties in Austin, TX and have moved into Oakland.
