Veritas / Yat-Pang Au / GreenTree
=================================

In 2011, [the vast Lembi empire was in default](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Walter-Lembi-s-empire-sets-off-investor-frenzy-2367788.php).   LNR, a subsidiary of the Lennar Company, [acquired](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2011/09/area-lands-lembi-portfolio-for-596.html) and resold the Lembi properties to investment groups such as Prado Group, Area Property Partners, Woodmont Company, and CIM Group. 

[Many of the former Lembi properties](https://www.cmalert.com/search.pl?ARTICLE=164965) are now controlled by Veritas LLC, a company founded by investor Yat-Pang Au, [considered one of the largest owners and operators of apartments in San Francisco.](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-06/21/content_16643650.htm)

Veritas controls over 100 LLCs and multi-unit properties in San Francisco.

Hundreds of units have been evicted and harassed through Veritas over the last several years.

Through the RentSFNow website, Veritas markets furnished apartments to transitory renters, thus evading the rent stabilization associated with long-term community members.
