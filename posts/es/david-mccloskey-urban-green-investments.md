URBAN GREEN INVESTMENTS, CEO: DAVID PALMER MCCLOSKEY
----------------------------------------------------

### Urban Green in Alameda County

[**The Beulah Home at 4690 Tompkins, Oakland CA**](http://www.laurelvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6NCPC-MinutesJune13.pdf) was built by the Methodist Church as a senior living community 60 years ago.  Urban Green Investments purchased Beulah Home in a bankruptcy sale.  Instead of keeping it as a senior residence and care facility, they have applied to the City to convert Beulah Home from one of Oakland’s oldest senior residence and care facilities to 40 ± 650 sq./ft. apartments.

The largest SRO Hotel in Oakland, the Claridge Hotel was acquired by Urban Green after its owner,  Richard Singer pleaded guilty to attempting to set fire to another of his Oakland SRO hotels.  Urban Green later transferred the hotel to Sarosh Kumana.  [SROs in Oakland are unregulated; vulnerable populations displaced from SROs are likely to be homeless.](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/affordable-no-more/Content?oid=4791392)

San Francisco Evictions
-----------------------

**Urban Green** gained notoriety in 2013 by evicting **Mary Elizabeth Phillips** from her home of 40 years on 55 Dolores Street through its [Dolores Street, LLC](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/55-dolores-street-llc/108407664.aspx). [The eviction was supposed to take place in April 2014, the month that Mary turned 98.](http://quartz.he.net/~beyondch/news/nucleus/plugins/print/print.php?itemid=11208) As Mary said, _"This has been my home for over 40 years and I don't want to leave. . . I am just too old."_ Mary has since refused to leave, as has her neighbor and caregiver Sarah Brandt, who teaches high school in the Unified School District. 

After Eviction-Free San Francisco held a protest at the office of Urban Green on July 8, the case received much media attention. [McCloskey announced to the press that Mary could stay in her home, but not Sarah. As Mary's lawyer says:](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/urban-green-says-evicted-sf-tenant-can-stay-but-attorney-cries-foul/Content?oid=2847773)

"Urban Green Investments (UGI) has filed a lawsuit to evict Mary Phillips, although they have not served it yet. Instead, they are proceeding with litigation against her close friend and caregiver Sarah Brant, who also lives in the building, understanding that if they evict Sarah, then Mary cannot remain as the sole occupant of a building that is being turned into a construction zone. The reality is that offering the 98 year old Mary Phillips the opportunity to live alone in a construction zone without her close friend and caregiver being able to stay in the building is an illusory offer, and UGI knows that. If they were truly concerned about Mary's welfare, they never would have served eviction notices in March of 2013, or would at the very least have told her then that she would not have to move at any time. UGI always intended to evict Mary, but the media attention to Mary's plight has changed UGI's attitude, not any concern for her wellbeing. Contrary to the statement, UGI's attorneys have commented extensively on Ms. Phillips' situation, including providing testimony at the California Assembly Housing Committee hearing where Mary testified on Ellis Act reform. A statement made on behalf of UGI's attorneys insinuated that Ms. Phillips's attorneys were preventing her from agreeing to UGI's proposals. UGI's efforts in publicizing settlement discussions is an attempt to deflect media attention away from their speculative evictions of seniors and disabled long-term tenants at this and other properties that they have purchased." -  Steve Collier Attorney at Law / Tenderloin Housing Clinic

**Update:** Because of public pressure, UGI is no longer evicting Mary. As of 2016, all of her neighbors however have been displaced, leaving the 100-year-old alone in the building while it undergoes extensive construction for condo-conversion. 

**Urban Green states its Company Description as**: [_"Urban Green Investments focuses on properties located in prime, central, high-barrier-to-entry submarkets of San Francisco. Through a network of relationships developed over the years, we are exposed to opportunities at an early stage. We are able to efficiently analyze opportunities and have the ability to make all-cash, quick closings. Once acquired, Urban Green Investments implements an asset plan tailored to the highest and best use of the property. The two main approaches to maximizing values are: 1) to renovate and increase existing cash-flow, and 2) to renovate and convert the property to a Tenancy in Common (TIC), then sell the property as individual owner-occupied units."_](http://www.zoominfo.com/s/#!search/profile/company?companyId=353769260&targetid=profile)

**Marla Knight,** who was until recently being evicted by UGI from her home in North Beach describes: [_“I like to use the term ‘demographic cleansing’ since that is what these evictions of moderate to low income people amount to. Though I guess the senior issue does get sympathy, and, of course, I am a senior, I think that there should be equal emphasis on families and artists. I tutor at Telegraph Hill Neighborhood Center and was talking with a ten year old who lives with her mom and dad and brother in a rental unit a few blocks from me in North Beach. Having brought my own daughters up in this lively neighborhood, one which my grandchildren love to come and do overnights with me, I was thinking how sad that this little girl's family is at risk. The loss of the middle class as you know does not bode well for the future of a city or, of course, a country”._](#)

*   **3431-3435 Mission Street (3 units)** - Petition Y001-10X, 12/28/1998. Lynch Associates, LLC; San Francisco Park Green; Wakefield LLC.
    

[Lynch Associates](https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2000/09/01/17492.php) do a lot of TIC (Tenancy in Common) evictions and have done three Ellis evictions. They are very active in the Mission. Various partners were involved in up to half a dozen owner move-in evictions since 1996. They specialize in "bluff" evictions: They give people OMI notices or Ellis notices; tenants move when they receive the notice; then Lynch withdraws the notice. One tenant activist calls them "bottom feeders." They buy rundown buildings and try to drive the tenants out however they can.

["The trick, Lynch says, is to invest in properties that have a high perceived risk -- which helps drive a better bargain -- with a property that has a low actual risk."](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2003/06/23/smallb1.html?page=all)
