PETER ISKANDAR
--------------

Iskandar Ellised a Greenwich Street  property now being advertised as a short term rental.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Peter Iskandar's “SF Affordable Housing LLC” purchased  531 Greenwich Street by being the successful over-bidder in a probate sale, closing a deal for $1,733,000 in March of 2010. Iskander's attorney, [Paul Utrecht](http://www.sfgate.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fnevius&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Paul+Utrecht%22), said the tenants received "generous" offers from Iskander. When they didn't move, he took them to court. 

[Imagine the sight of Carlo Tarrone, who is in his 70s and uses a walker, and](#) [Sandy Bishop](http://www.sfgate.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=bayarea%2Fnevius&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Sandy+Bishop%22)[, who is 70 and has lung cancer, forced out of their homes.](#)

'[I can't even find a place to live because I don't make enough money," Bishop said. "Maybe I should just stay and let the sheriff carry me out.](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Developer-Peter-Iskander-s-tactics-against-tenants-2374970.php#photo-1903909)'"

**525 - 531 Greenwich Street has since been converted to a site of short term vacation rentals.**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Someone reported to us: **"You'll remember the building on Greenwich St. where four seniors were Ellised after a long battle (525 - 529 Greenwich).  I've been watching multiple people moving in and out of those units for a couple of years now, and finally today one of them said in casual conversation that they had rented the unit through Airbnb."**

Iskandar is a managing broker at [Bubble Realty](http://bubblerealestate.com/about/agents/) and [Master Builders](http://www.masterbuilderssf.com/company/team/index.html), and owns a number of LLCs including [Ichi Nuts, LLC](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/ichi-nuts-llc/47680892.aspx), [Sf Twin Boys Corporatio](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/sf-twin-boys-corporation/44189152.aspx)n,  [Sf Affordable Housing LLC,](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/San-Francisco/sf-affordable-housing-llc/47158900.aspx) and [Lee B. DO, LLC](http://www.corporationwiki.com/p/2ebrh1/lee-b-do-llc).

**He has committed the following Ellis Act Evictions:**

**454 Vallejo Street** (3 units) Ellised on 11/8/2007 by Affordable Housing, LLC, Peter Iskandar, Jahja Iskandar, and Paul Utrecht. Petition: L071705450.

**525 - 531 Greenwich Street** (4 units) Ellised on 3/23/2010 by Affordable Housing, LLC, Peter Iskandar, and Jahja Iskandar. Petition L100368525.

A tenant organizer describes: "As i walk around my neighborhood, I can count out the number of buildings that [WB Coyle,](/serial-evictions) Iskandar and Michael Bevier have bought up. I can also count 10 buildings that were "buyouts" meaning some for less than what the relocation fee law dictates and just a couple that were substantially more."

Another tenant wrote: "When my new place to live wanted to know what kind of renter I was with Peter Iskandar. Peter told his office girl to write that I was prostituting in my apt and I had destroyed our common area. I was denied a new place to live because of his anger/ lies towards me. I finally went to see the people who denied me a place to live and said I would call Peters office and talk to his office person to tell the truth or I would Sue for slander. I got the place I wanted to live in. I was sorry they changed their story cause I'd have loved to Sue him and his business. I live in Santa Cruz and I am happy here. I just hate what is happening in S.F. People like Peter Iskander are sick property owners. The Greed must stop for a healthy life. I was 69 yrs old when this happened."
