Made in collaboration with SOTA

Sylvia Smith, a grandmother and long time Mission resident, faced eviction. This video was produced in collaboration with the San Francisco Ruth Assawa School of the Arts. The interview was shot by Rebecca Gourevitch of the AEMP for her amazing short 'Holding Out', with additional photography and editing by students Linda de la Rosa and Dylan Lalanne Perkins.
