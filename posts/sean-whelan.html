He is the main lawyer involved in evicting elderly tenants. He also owns Ellis buildings and is evicting his own tenants.</em></p><p><em>Zacks represents the owners of the Hotel Chronicle, a residential hotel that is home to 16 tenants, many of whom have lived there for decades. The owners are using the Ellis Act to get the tenants out of the building, saying that they want to leave the rental business.</em></p><p><em>Zacks also represents the owners of the Astoria Hotel, a 92-room residential hotel that was ordered by the court to stop renting its rooms to tourists. In a similar case, Zacks represents owners of the Cornell Hotel on Bush Street who want to turn almost half of their units from residential units to tourist use. He took their case to the Supreme Court. And he represents the owners of the Remo Hotel in North Beach who want to convert their hotel to tourist use.</em><br><em>Under the SF Residential Hotel Conversion Ordinance, residential hotels can't be converted to tourist hotels without a conditional use permit.
