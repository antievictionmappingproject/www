    >Chokatos v. Magnate Fund # 1 CA1/3</a
  >, plaintiffs alleged that "defendant Benny Chetcuti, Jr., represented himself
  as an experienced real estate developer offering safe investment opportunities
  in his projects when, in fact, he was operating a Ponzi scheme with John
  Simonse and their related companies.According to plaintiffs’ complaints,
  Chetcuti and his company Chetcuti &amp; Associates, Inc. (collectively,
  Chetcuti) 'borrowed money from his victims, usually short term loans, with the
  promise of high ... returns.' Chetcuti signed promissory notes and issued
  deeds of trust to properties owned by himself or other entities' to secure the
  loans. Before recording the lenders’ deeds of trust, Chetcuti issued and
  recorded deeds of trust in favor of Simonse and related entities on unfunded
  sham loans “that would totally encumber the property.' 'Simonse and his other
  entities would then foreclose on the properties, leaving the victims without
  any security for their loans, and defendant Simonse and his entities would
  have free and clear title to the properties, without actually making any
  loans. Defendant Simonse would then create new entities, and transfer title of
  the foreclosed properties to the newly created entities, without any
  consideration, to make the properties even more removed and difficult for the
  creditors and victims of defendant Chetcuti to recover the security for their
  loans.' 'When defendant Chetcuti could not find enough investors to pay for
  various other loans, the scheme collapsed, leaving his victims with unpaid
  promissory notes with no security for their loans.' Chetcuti filed for
  bankruptcy. According to plaintiff Chokatos,<strong
