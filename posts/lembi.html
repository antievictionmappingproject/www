<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>In its previous incarnation as CitiApartments and Lembi properties, this San Francisco company made headlines with “a stunning array of unlawful business and tenant harassment practices” &nbsp;during the lawsuit and subsequent injunction obtained by City Attorney Herrera. After paying bloated prices - sometimes 16x the asking price, the Lembi empire would dispatch armed security guards to harass tenants in order to scare them out of their rent-controlled apartments. Tactics included breaking into apartments, shutting off utilities, changing locks, and retaliating against those who refuse to take buy-outs.. By 2011,&nbsp;the vast Lembi empire was in default. &nbsp;&nbsp;LNR, a subsidiary of the Lennar Company,&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;and resold the Lembi properties to investment groups such as Prado Group, Area Property Partners, Woodmont Company, and CIM Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the former Lembi properties&nbsp;are now controlled by Veritas LLC, San Francisco’s biggest landlord.&nbsp;</em></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.antievictionmap.com/lembi-family/" target="_blank">Click to read “The Lembi Family” page.</a></p>
