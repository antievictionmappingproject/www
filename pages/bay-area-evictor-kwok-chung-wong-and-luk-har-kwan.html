<h2 class="text-align-center">KWONG CHUNG WONG &amp; LUK HAR KWAN</h2><p><span>In December of 2004,</span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfbg.com/39/08/news_condos.html">Semoy Kosoy</a><span>, a65-year-old Holocaust survivor, was Ellis Acted from his home of 14 years, along with his wife, Olga Sinitsa, who has been undergoing chemotherapy. There were four units evicted from the building at442 23rd Avenue by</span><strong>Kwok Chung Wong and Luk Har Kwan.</strong><span>They hadbought the building for $1.1 million, and then immediately put three of the units up for sale as TICs. Kwan and Wong put one of the units on the market for $488,500. If all four units sold at that price, it would mean a potential gain of 81 percent.</span></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/DonnaJohnsonFinal"><strong>Donna Saffioti-Johnson</strong><br>(Community worker &amp; ‘Hood Momma’), Pearl Street, San Francisco</a></p><p>Donna, her husband Robert “Jawara” Johnson, and the family dogs Xochitl (age 4) and DJ (age 2 and ½) were served with Ellis Act eviction papers in 2012, and forced out of their 73-B Pearl Street in San Francisco by serial evictorsKwok Chung Wong and Har Kwan Luk. Since 2003, this company has Ellis Acted 30 units in San Francisco, including the 6 units at Donna’s former home building on Pearl Street.</p><p>Originally from Detroit, Donna arrived to San Francisco in 1980. Her first job was as an au pair, and her first lodging was a vestibule under a stairwell. Donna moved into her Pearl Street apartment in 1984 and lived there for 29 years, until her eviction. She has worked 34 continuous years providing community services. In the ’80s, she worked in AIDS prevention and intervention, and founded one of the earliest youth needle exchange programs in the City. Donna has worked at Horizons Unlimited for 26 years, primarily, in substance abuse and prevention education in jails and schools, and as an individual counselor and street outreach professional. She is a beloved Hood Momma to many street affiliated youth with whom she has come into contact through work and life.</p><p>Building directly from the foundations of trust laid by Donna and a formal collaboration with Nora Reddick, Executive Director at Horizons Unlimited, Adriana Camarena worked with a group of gang-affiliated youth to form a collaboration called the Late Night Poets. The Late Night Poets are now working towards self-publishing a book of their poetic writings.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wong and Luk have Ellis Acted 30 units:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>69 Pearl
