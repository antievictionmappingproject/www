Researchers at Eviction Lab, a project led by Princeton sociologist Matthew Desmond, author of Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, identified 43,000 evictions in California last year. However, due to the masking of unlawful detainer records from public view in California, the full spectrum of eviction data is unavailable using standard research tools. Eviction Lab noted the limits on its California research when it released the national data and the need for further research.”</p>","wp:post_name":"2018/6/1/unlawful-detainer-evictions-in-california","wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_id":"184","wp:status":"publish","pubDate":"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 21:04:14 +0000","wp:post_date":"2018-06-01 21:04:14","wp:post_date_gmt":"2018-06-01 21:04:14","passthrough_url":"https://antievictionmap.com/uds-in-ca/","post_tag":["Evictions"],"category":["California"],"dc:creator":"erinmcel@gmail.com","wp:comment_status":"open","_thumbnail_id":"185"}
