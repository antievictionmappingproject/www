<h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Covid-19 Housing Protections Legislation and Housing Justice Action Map</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://covid19.antievictionmap.com" target="_blank">Click to view map or contribute your own data.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In a time of turmoil and uncertainty for many tenants, knowledge about rights and protections is crucial for staying housed and safe during the global pandemic. Released in April by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, <a href="https://covid19.antievictionmap.com/#lat=20&amp;lng=40&amp;z=3&amp;states=true&amp;cities=true&amp;nations=true&amp;rentstrike=true"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>COVID-19 Housing Protection Legislation &amp; Housing Justice Action Map</em></span></a> is an interactive tool to track emergency responses — public policy as well as rent strikes and housing justice campaigns — arising around the world in the wake of COVID-19. The map also tracks policies that have expired or lapsed as state-of-emergencies are lifted.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To better convey information that could keep countless households afloat during this crisis, AEMP has developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3axqpwvJ_GRTNoVzX1U5PMxHesSgzJaToEC05cmaRQ/edit#"><span style="text-decoration:underline">policy scoring system</span></a> aimed to evaluate tenant protections enacted by states and local governments in the US. Our non-US data is being manually scored by community partners active in various countries and regions, as we know that there is no way to universalize land and housing histories, action, and legislation. We are also currently working on internationalization that includes localization and translation features, which we will be implementing soon. The US-based scoring is informed by AEMP’s research and crowdsourced information on hundreds of COVID-19 tenant protections from city, county, and statewide emergency ordinances, declarations, and legislation.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This map is a collective effort supported by folks all over the world who are contributing updates about tenant protections or housing justice actions in their region. Viewers can use one of two forms to either add information about a tenant protection policy in their respective city, county, or state, or about a housing justice action (ie rent strike) that they are a part of. Please share <a href="https://covid19.antievictionmap.com/#lat=20&amp;lng=40&amp;z=3&amp;states=true&amp;cities=true&amp;nations=true&amp;rentstrike=true"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this map</span></a> with your networks, and encourage folks to contribute any rent strikes or emergency protections as they develop, along with policies as they expire. This map relies upon your contributions in order to stay up to date! If a more local version of this tool would be useful to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:antievictionmap@riseup.net"><span style="text-decoration:underline">antievictionmap@riseup.net</span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>While the AEMP maintains close relationships with a number of tenant organizations and networks, this development of this map has in particular relied upon collaboration with the <a href="https://mappingaction.org/">Mapping Action Collective</a>, <a href="http://www.tenantstogether.org/">Tenants Together</a>, the <a href="http://sfadc.org/landingpage/covid-19/">San Francisco Anti-Displacement Coalition</a>, <a href="https://ebho.org/">&nbsp;East Bay Housing Organizations</a>,<a href="http://communityjusticeproject.com/"> Community Justice Project</a>,<a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/emily-benfer"> Dr. Emily Benfer</a>, and <a href="https://bayarearentstrike.org/">Bay Area Rent Strike (BARS)</a> organizers, as well as assistance in international research from our friends at <a href="https://notanatlas.org/about/">kollektiv orangotango</a> and the <a href="https://housingnotprofit.org/">European Action Coalition for the Right to Housing.</a>&nbsp; We are grateful for consultation from <a href="https://righttothecity.org/">Right To The City Alliance</a>,<a href="https://www.policylink.org/"> Policy Link</a>,<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/profile/lisa-bates"> Dr. Lisa Bates</a>, and<a href="http://www.publicjustice.org/en/john-pollock-attorney/"> John Pollock</a> from <a href="https://www.publicjustice.net/">Public Justice</a>, Greg Townley from the <a href="https://www.psuf.org/homelessness-research-action-collaborative">Homelessness Research Action Collaborative</a>, and Leeor Schwitzer from <a href="https://www.pdxtu.org/">Portland Tenants United</a>.</p>
